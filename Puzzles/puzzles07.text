;; Puzzle 1: No-starve Readers-writers 

    ;; SHARED
    1   readSwitch = Lightswitch() 
    2   roomEmpty  = Semaphore(1)
    3   turnstile  = Semaphore(1)

    ;; READERS THREAD 
    1   turnstile.wait() 
    2   turnstile.signal()
    3   readSwitch.lock(roomEmpty) 
    4   critical section 
    5   readSwitch.unlock(roomEmpty)

    ;; WRITERS THREAD 
    1   turnstile.wait() 
    2   roomEmpty.wait() 
    3   critical section
    4   roomEmpty.signal()
    5   turnstile.signal()

    ;; EXPLANATION
        A turnstile was added to the front of the reader thread, only allowing
    a thread through the turnstile if it has not been blocked. However, 
    whenever a writer thread is called, it blocks the turnstile, not allowing
    other reader threads to enter the room. Then, since the reader threads 
    will eventually leave the room, and no threads can enter the room while 
    the writer thread is waiting, the writer thread will eventually be able 
    to go through when the roomEmpty finally signals. 
        When the writer thread finishes the room empty, it will signal, 
    and finally release the turnstile, allowing other reader threads to 
    go into the room. Note that this prevents starvation, as the writer 
    will eventually be able to write, as long as the readers eventually leave, 
    as readers can no longer enter while the writer is waiting to enter.

Questions:
1) Note that the time complexity of the program depends on Fun; however,
    in most mapping, Fun is usually O(1), so we will assume so moving forwards.
   Then, if given enough cores, the time complexity is O(n), as since 
   all operations can be done at the same time, that means that the time will
   be only be limited by the longest operation of Fun, which is O(1).
   However, adding them all to the same list takes O(n) as we need to add
   n elements to a list. 
   It is the same if we don't have enough cores, but will be slower in 
   practicality. 
2) If you have smaller messages, you can start working on them as they come in;
   meaning, you can do work while waiting for other messages to come in. 
   However, if you send it all at once, then the program must wait for the
   whole thing to be finished before it can start doing any work. 
   In addition, it can help keep the mailbox empty, as the process can collect
   the messages as they come in, versus dumping a heavy load on the mailbox 
   all at once.
